You also get a ""sample""-sized package of Kay-Tee bedding nad Kay-Tee food (which my GP finished in one night).  There\'s one serious omission: the absence of any sort of enclosure for the pig to nest, hide, sleep in and feel secure.  If you order a plastic one from Amazon, be absolutely certain that it specifically says: ""For guinea pigs.""  (The ones for hamsters, rats, gerbils, etc., are WAY too small--simply unusable.  Also, the food dish that Kaytee supplies is a light, deep plastic bowl with a narrow base.  Buy a ceramic ergonomic dish from Amazon asap. The Kay-Tee dish practically ensures that all of the food will be dumped out and mixed in with the bedding (unlike potbelly pigs, Guinea pigs don\'t have a ""radar nose"" capable of finding each small piece of food (I\'m frequently picking up pieces of carrot or celery on the floor of the cage when the animal is begging for more food, seemingly unaware of the half-eaten pieces lying at his feet.)  The heavy ergonomic dish is definitely worth the investment.Finally, the included water bottle is usable but problematic.  It\'s barely transparent, making it hard to tell where the water level is except under the brightest light.  The single plastic-covered wire that is included for fastening the bottle to the cage is not up to the task.  After a couple of weeks, you\'ll probably want to look for a water bottle that\'s clear and that comes with a spring-loaded wire for fastening i to the cage.  As for plastic vs. glass, I wouldn\'t consider that a decision-breaker.  Either one should work.Last reminder: Guinea pigs require Vitamin C since they don\'t manufacture it from their food.

I have to say that while my wife does like it, there are obvious issues with gen5.

You can buy a box of cereal and put it in an airtight container, but with the perfect conditions, the larveae will hatch. Humidity and warmth encourage these pests to hatch, grow, and thrive. It is very hard to get rid of pantry moths once you get them as they will lay eggs anywhere in your home and as soon as the right conditions permit, they will hatch. Spring and summer are usually the most active months for these little pests. I have learned to place things like cereals, flour, and rice into a second refrigerator designated for food items that contain grains. Most people cannot afford a second refrigerator, so my suggestion is to place these items in a freezer for about one week  (longer is better) to kill the larvae that may be in the food when you get it from the grocery. Densely packaged item such as bags of flour should be split up into 3 parts and then frozen. Yes, I know it\'s a pain in the tush, but I have not found another way around this bug problem. Remove from the freezer and place in airtight containers. If you still see pantry moths, they are somewhere in your home. They can lay larvae in the clothes in your closet, behind baseboards, or anywhere you can think of and then some. The U. S. is prone to these infestations because we have lax regulations when it comes to importing foods from other countries that have even more lax food regulations. Processed foods, even pet foods, are prone to bug larvae. Buying organic is not the solution either, and may actually be worse as no pesticides have used in the growing of these things. Some bugs lay their larvae inside the grain kernel and they don\'t hatch until you get that box of cereal home.
